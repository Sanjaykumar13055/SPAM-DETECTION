# SPAM-DETECTION
The code reads a CSV file (spam.csv) containing SMS messages labeled as spam or non-spam. It preprocesses the data by splitting it into features (X) and labels (Y). The text data (X) is vectorized using CountVectorizer to convert it into numerical format suitable for SVM. The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% test).
